## Show your R code!

Code can be embebed in Quarto like this: 

```{r}
1 + 1
```

---

## Show your R code!

We can highlight only the part that we care when we give a presentation: 

```{.r code-line-numbers="1"}
1 + 1
```


---

## O don't show it, show the results only!

We can hide the code and show the results only:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

---

## Create columns to add information!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::

:::{.column width = "50%"}
:::

::::

---

## Inverse Slide {.inverse}

This slide has dramatically different styling with an inverse color scheme.

- The background is yellow.
- The text is grey.


---

## Make the citation in a fancy way:

As @my-citation-key-for-r say: "blah blah blah"

---

## Add tabsets to explain more in depth some issue!

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}

### Tab A

Content for `Tab A`

### Tab B

Content for `Tab B`

:::

---

## We can add notes!

:::{.callout-note}
This is an example of an tip callout
:::

--- 

## We can add footnotes!

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.
